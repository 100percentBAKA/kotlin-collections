In Kotlin, there is a difference between HashMap and Map.

Map is an interface that represents a read-only collection of key-value pairs. It defines operations to access values based on keys, 
iterate over the pairs, and perform other common operations. Map is designed to be immutable, meaning that once created, 
its content cannot be modified. Kotlin provides several implementations of the Map interface, including HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.

HashMap is a specific implementation of the Map interface. It uses a hash table data structure to store the key-value pairs, 
providing efficient lookup and retrieval operations. HashMap does not guarantee a specific order for the key-value pairs. 
It is generally the most commonly used implementation when the order of the elements is not important.

Here are some key differences between HashMap and Map:

Mutable vs. Immutable: Map is an interface representing an immutable collection of key-value pairs, 
while HashMap is a specific mutable implementation of the Map interface.

Order: HashMap does not guarantee any specific order for the key-value pairs. 
The iteration order may vary between different runs or modifications to the map. On the other hand, other implementations of Map, 
such as LinkedHashMap or TreeMap, may provide a specific order or sorting based on the keys.

Mutability: HashMap allows you to modify its contents by adding, removing, or updating key-value pairs. 
In contrast, a Map obtained from a HashMap or other implementations is read-only and cannot be modified directly.

Nullability: Both Map and HashMap allow null values and null keys, but they have different nullability guarantees. 
A Map interface doesn't provide any specific nullability guarantees, whereas HashMap allows null values and a single null key.

In summary, Map is the interface representing a read-only collection of key-value pairs, 
while HashMap is a specific implementation that provides mutable, unordered storage of key-value pairs using a hash table.
